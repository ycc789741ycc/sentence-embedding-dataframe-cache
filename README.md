## Introduction

Implement the sentence embedding retriever with local cache from the embedding store.

## Features

* Embedding store abstraction class

* Support Jina client implementation embedding store

## Installation

```bash
```

## Quick Start

* Using Jina flow serve the embedding model

```python
```

* Inherit from the abstraction class

```python
```

# Road Map

[Done] prototype abstraction

[Done] Unit-test, integration test

[Todo] Embedding retriever implementation: Pytorch, Jina

* [Done] Jina

* [Todo] Sentence Embedding

[Done] Docker service

[Todo] Example, Documentation

[Todo] Embedding monitor

[Improve] Accelerate the Pandas retriever efficiency
